ðŸ’» This is a simple one-page website that holds my social media links.
It provides an easy way for me to share all the platforms I use and for people to easily find and connect with me. 

ðŸ‘¾ I started this project with a HTML5 Boilerplate as the foundation. 

ðŸŽ¨ If you have any design/code suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, please feel free to reach out, open an issue, or submit a pull request.
